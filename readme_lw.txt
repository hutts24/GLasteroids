These files were recorded at 120Hz using a Vicon system and resampled to 30fps.

The motion was mapped to a skeleton by using Kaydara's Filmbox and then imported into Lightwave.
BTW, retargeting and mapping the motion directly onto your custom skeleton instead of a hierarchy of nulls is also possible.


Note: T.lws is a reference T-pose which might be usefull when connecting the sample data to a custom skeleton.
