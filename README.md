Dodgy demo game program to test features of the 'Blah' 3D game engine

Features:
- Keyboard input to control the ship.
- Text is rendered in a dodgy hand drawn font I made.
- 3D models are free lightwave files I found scattered around the internet years ago.
- Third person and 'cockpit' view points.
